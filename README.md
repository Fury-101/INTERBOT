# INTERHACK BOT
Discord Bot--For Hackathon


Hey, my name is InterHackBot. I guess you could figure out from my name that I'm an International Hackathon Discord Bot. I specialize in helping your discord run smoother, and help you win your competition. I have many features ranging from a timezone converter to a personalized ID. Here are the features:

                                               Remember my prefix is the "."

1. Like many of the normal bots I can also use clear to clear a few texts, all text, and a specified amount of text messages
2. I have special feature which can convert over 30 timezones including EST and PST8PDT. You can view which timezones by just using the timezones command
3. Trying to look for teammates. Well I have a specialized ID feature which allows you to create an ID displaying information of you such as your skillset or if you are still looking for teammates. You can also view others' ID and based on that team up with them.
4. Having teammates of a different country? No problem! You can use the translation feature to translate over 75+ languages. You can also view which languages by using the translationlist command.
5. Need to set a timer for work? Need to remind your teammates to get working? Don't worry we have it all covered for you! We have the time and reminder features to help you and your teammate to work much more efficiently.
6. We also have a feature to let admins put information of the hackathon. They can put the overview, the schedule, the prizes, and many more!

Hackathons have been getting more popular and as discord continues to serve as a major communication platform, we all need some discord bots to help with the overall structure,                                                             flow, and communication.
